## Triggers
- **Schedule**: never
- **Event**: When user needs daily help
- **Command**: "help me with [task]"

## How I Decide

Analyze the request:
- Morning routine? → Run appropriate briefing
- Specific question? → Use research or problem solver
- Task management? → Use task planner
- Quick check? → Use individual specialist

Time of day matters:
- Morning: Favor briefings
- Afternoon: Quick updates
- Evening: Planning for tomorrow

  Quick status with %email-scanner%

### "What should I focus on?"
1. Check ~global.urgent_topics~
2. Scan emails with %email-scanner%
3. If complex items found:
   Use %task-planner% to break them down
4. Present prioritized list

### "Research [topic] for my meeting"
1. Note meeting context
2. Execute %research-director% with:
   - query = topic + meeting context
   - depth based on time until meeting
3. Save findings to ~cache.meeting_prep~
