# Claude Agents

A markdown-based agent system where agents are defined purely in `.md` files, with tools and composition capabilities. Each agent team can work together to accomplish complex tasks through natural language specifications.

**üìÅ See [STRUCTURE.md](STRUCTURE.md) for project organization**

## What This Does

This repository contains intelligent agents that:

- Are defined entirely in markdown files
- Can use tools (via MCP servers) to interact with external systems
- Can compose with other agents to form teams
- Execute complex workflows through natural language instructions

## Current Agent Teams

### üì± X Poster Workflow

Automatically finds and posts daily Claude Code tips to X (Twitter):

- **X Tip Finder**: Searches X for Claude Code tips and tricks
- **X Tip Curator**: Selects the best unique tip to post
- **X Post Writer**: Formats engaging posts
- **Session Manager**: Tracks workflow progress

## How It Works

1. **Agents are Markdown**: Each agent is a `.md` file with structured sections defining its behavior
2. **Tools via MCP**: External capabilities (APIs, databases) are provided through MCP servers
3. **Natural Language**: Agents follow instructions written in plain English
4. **Composition**: Agents can invoke other agents to handle complex workflows

## Running Agents

## Tool Library

The `/agents/tool-library/` directory contains markdown documentation for all MCP tools available in this repository. Each tool has:

- Installation instructions
- Configuration requirements
- Usage examples
- Natural language descriptions

Teams can customize tool usage by creating their own tool markdown in their team folder.

## Creating New Agents

2. Place in appropriate team folder
3. Document required tools in team's tool folder
4. Test with Claude Code

## Philosophy

- **Simplicity**: Agents are just markdown files
- **Composability**: Agents work together naturally
- **Flexibility**: Natural language allows easy customization
- **Transparency**: Everything is human-readable
