# Coordinator

I manage execution of specialists, workflows, and other coordinators.

## What I Handle

- **Specialists**: %agent-name% - Single-purpose agents
- **Workflows**: @workflow-name@ - Sequential pipelines  
- **Coordinators**: %coordinator-name% - Dynamic orchestration

## Execution Types

### Running a Specialist
```
Execute %email-scanner%
```
Direct execution with input/output.

### Running a Workflow
```
Execute @daily-briefing@
```
Sequential steps with context passing between agents.

### Running a Coordinator
```
Execute %research-coordinator% with query
```
Dynamic orchestration based on the situation.

## From Schedule

Check schedule.md for time-based triggers:
```
09:00 → @daily-briefing@
14:00 → %news-scanner%
*/30 → %email-checker%
```

## Session Management

For workflows and coordinators:
- Create session ID
- Track progress in ~session.current~
- Store context between steps
- Handle failures and resumption

## Error Handling

If something fails:
- Log the error
- Save session state
- Try to continue if possible
- Report what worked and what didn't
